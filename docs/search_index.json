If you need more temporarily, please ask on the mailing list. Tabebuia’s disk space is not designed for long-term data storage. Try to clean up your data as soon as you do not need them anymore. You can use a hard drive connected to Tabebuia or a direct link to Roucou to avoid storing raw data on Tabebuia. You also need to ask short term staff to clean up their session before the end of their contract. Add a description of the diskusage tool here with links to documentation.
