This is a draft, the wiki will further develop later. Have a nice reading. Sylvain "],["connection.html", "Chapter 1 Connection 1.1 Remote Desktop 1.2 Rstudio server", " Chapter 1 Connection 1.1 Remote Desktop The most common connection to Tabebuia is via the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) although other methods such as SSH tunneling can be used. 1.1.0.1 Windows In windows use the “Remote Desktop Connection” tool with the address tabebuia.ecofog.gf: knitr::include_graphics(&quot;img/remote_desktop_windows.jpeg&quot;) You will be connected to Tabebuia and have to enter your email and password in the XRDP security to connect to your session: knitr::include_graphics(&quot;img/xrdp.jpeg&quot;) 1.1.1 Linux Under Linux you can use different tools, but I recommend Remmina which is quite common. In the main window, you can create a profile for the Tabebuia RDP connection: knitr::include_graphics(&quot;img/remmina_main.png&quot;) you can directly enter your user name (email) and password to avoid connecting through XRDP: knitr::include_graphics(&quot;img/remmina_tabebuia.png&quot;) 1.2 Rstudio server You may also only want to use R via the Rstudio server and not connect to a remote desktop. For that connect to the interface at: https://rstudio2.ecofog.gf/ . knitr::include_graphics(&quot;img/rstudio_login.png&quot;) Use your email and password and you’ll have access to an Rstudio interface within your browser: knitr::include_graphics(&quot;img/rstudio.png&quot;) More information can be found at: https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200552306-Getting-Started . "],["basic-usage.html", "Chapter 2 Basic usage 2.1 Ganglia 2.2 Google sheets 2.3 Mailing list", " Chapter 2 Basic usage Please follow these steps before starting a calculation on Tabebuia: Check the cluster load at: http://tabebuia.ecofog.gf/ganglia Indicate your scheduled usage for each day at: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b3uUrY0Wy9p4joah7N_JM49LVqHAxR3eUYSRHQZYxEU/edit?usp=sharing Run and monitor your calculation If there is a shortage of resources, you can use the mailing list or contact connected users to ask them to specify their use or reduce their consumption. 2.1 Ganglia Ganglia is installed on Tabebuia and can be seen at: http://tabebuia.ecofog.gf/ganglia. Ganglia is a system observer to check in time memory and CPU usage on the cluster: knitr::include_graphics(&quot;img/ganglia.png&quot;) More information can be found at: http://ganglia.info/ . 2.2 Google sheets For now, the shared usage on Tabebuia is organised in a google doc where each user defines how many CPUs and memory (per 10GB) they need for how many days. The google doc is available here :https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b3uUrY0Wy9p4joah7N_JM49LVqHAxR3eUYSRHQZYxEU/edit?usp=sharing. Just add your initial to book resources: knitr::include_graphics(&quot;img/gsheets.png&quot;) It is obvious that there is no control of the reserved use, so try to respect what you indicate. 2.3 Mailing list In case you need to contact all or certain users, a mailing list is maintained at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/191y_8Yc8j8a0mGkMUXOlo6ImyFjUyasCEeVGQ1kySlo/edit?usp=sharing.

So try to avoid using more than 200GB per user (for 25 users). If you need more temporarily, please ask on the mailing list. Tabebuia’s disk space is not designed for long-term data storage. Try to clean up your data as soon as you do not need them anymore. You can use a hard drive connected to Tabebuia or a direct link to Roucou to avoid storing raw data on Tabebuia. You also need to ask short term staff to clean up their session before the end of their contract. Use MATE Disk usage Analyzer to monitor your disk usage efficiently; knitr::include_graphics(&quot;img/diskusage.png&quot;) More information can be found at: https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Apps/DiskUsageAnalyzer . "],["handling-fastq.html", "Chapter 6 Handling fastq", " Chapter 6 Handling fastq You often obtain sequences data as FASTQ files. A first common step is to check the quality of your library before trimming low quality areas. To check fastq files quality fastqc is installed on Tabebuia: fastqc -t 2 -q library_R1.fq --outdir=library fastqc -t 2 -q library_R2.fq --outdir=library -q is used to indicate the file -t can be used to define the number of cores to use (check the Usage section) --outdir to define the output directory More can be found here: https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/. To trim your fastq files Trimmomatic is installed on Tabebuia: trimmomatic PE -threads 4 library_R1.fq library_R2.fq \\ library_R1_paired.fq library_R1_unpaired.fq \\ library_R2_paired.fq library_R2_unpaired.fq \\ ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:30:10:2:keepBothReads \\ SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 2&gt; trimmomatic.log PE is used to indicate that we have pair-end sequenced libraries threads can be used to define the number of cores to use (check the Usage section) You then need to indicate your two libraries (R1 and R2) and paired and unpaired output for each Then you need to indicate the type of adaptor to clean, here ILLUMINACLIP found in the file TruSeq3-PE.fa with a seed mismatches of 2 (mismatched count allowed), a threshold for clipping palindrome of 30 (authorized match for ligated adapters), a threshold for simple clip of 10 (match between adapter and sequence), a minimum adaptor length of 2, and keeping both reads each time Finally you can trim sequences on phred score, here with a minimum of 15 in sliding window of 4 the 2&gt; output allow you to save the command into a log file More can be found here: http://www.usadellab.org/cms/uploads/supplementary/Trimmomatic/TrimmomaticManual_V0.32.pdf.
