Ganglia is a system observer to check in time memory and CPU usage on the cluster: knitr::include_graphics(&quot;img/ganglia.png&quot;) More information can be found at: http://ganglia.info/ . 1.2 Google sheets For now, the shared usage on Tabebuia is organised in a google doc where each user defines how many CPUs and memory (per 10GB) they need for how many days. The google doc is available here :https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b3uUrY0Wy9p4joah7N_JM49LVqHAxR3eUYSRHQZYxEU/edit?usp=sharing. Just add your initial to book resources: knitr::include_graphics(&quot;img/gsheets.png&quot;) It is obvious that there is no control of the reserved use, so try to respect what you indicate. 1.3 Mailing list In case you need to contact all or certain users, a mailing list is maintained at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/191y_8Yc8j8a0mGkMUXOlo6ImyFjUyasCEeVGQ1kySlo/edit?usp=sharing.

So try to avoid using more than 200GB per user (for 25 users). If you need more temporarily, please ask on the mailing list. Tabebuia’s disk space is not designed for long-term data storage. Try to clean up your data as soon as you do not need them anymore. You can use a hard drive connected to Tabebuia or a direct link to Roucou to avoid storing raw data on Tabebuia. You also need to ask short term staff to clean up their session before the end of their contract. Use MATE Disk usage Analyzer to monitor your disk usage efficiently; knitr::include_graphics(&quot;img/diskusage.png&quot;) More information can be found at: https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Apps/DiskUsageAnalyzer .
